# [Project: Knight Travails](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails)

For this project I used a data structure similar to a binary tree, called a Graph as referenced in [this article] (https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/describing-graphs)

# Creating the Graph

I used this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-graph-javascript/#) from geeksforgeeks as well as some internal links in order to create a Graph to model the Knight's movement across the board and find it's shortest path from start to end
